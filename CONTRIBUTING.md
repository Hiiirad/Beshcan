## Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I actively welcome your pull requests:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!
